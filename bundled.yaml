    The Cascade REST API


    **NOTE:** Cascade is working on a new, more flexible version of the API.
    This REST API will be deprecated. Cascade advises against building any
    complex logic on it.

  - name: Goals
    description: >-
      *Goals* are the core resource of the Cascade application. They are the
      elementary units of a strategic plan.
  - name: Issues
    description: >-
      *Issues* document problems and risks for a particular goal.

      In Cascade's help articles and UI-facing documentation, issues are usually
      referred to as "risks."
  - name: Entity templates
    description: >-
      *Entity templates* let you make custom fields for your goals and
      workflows.

      To work with entity templates in the UI, select your profile, then
      **Customize Fields**.
  - name: Org units
    description: >-
      *Org units* represent individual components of your organization
      hierarchy.
  - name: Roles
    description: >-
      *Roles* are the positions that users have in your organization. They are
      also how Cascade manages permissions and resource ownership.

      Roles are deeply connected to some key features of the Cascade
      application:

      * Each user has a role.

      * All permissions are based on roles.

      * Each goal is associated with a specific roles.

      Besides assigning permissions and goals, you can also use roles to emulate
      the structure of your internal organization within your Cascade instance.
      For example, every manager can have the role `Manager`, and every
      supervisor can have the role `Supervisor`, etc.
  - name: Tasks
    description: >-
      *Tasks* are the individual bits of work that combine together to complete
      a goal. You can use tasks to break up individual components of a goal.

        Fetch some or all goal records, using filters to fetch subsets.


        To filter the response to a subset of goals, use the query params.

        If you want to include multiple values in a param, you can separate them
        with commas.

        For example, this call returns goals that have `id` values of `1` and
        `2`


        ```shell

        curl --location --request GET
        'https://csegeneral.executestrategy.net/api/v2/goals?id=1,2'

        --header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'

        Custom Attributes for Issues (a.k.a risks). There are four fields:

         - `CA1573011364578`: Risk Score Value

        You can configure values for `likelihood` and `consequence`.

        Cascade supplies values for `Risk Score` and `Risk Score Value`.
